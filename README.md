üåç # EarthsEvolution
EarthsEvolution | WWDC24 Project

üî¨ When I was in school I was very passionate about science.
It was my habit to turn every science topic I covered into a keynote, because I thought it was an innovative and interesting way to explain school topics.
One of the topics covered during those years that struck me the most was the one about Earth Science: it is really fascinating to find out about the origin of our planet and its formation, it opens your eyes to the place in the universe that is hosting you and you feel more in touch with it.
Specifically, I think it's really interesting to understand the formation and continuous evolution of the Earth's crust, finding out what's behind phenomena like earthquakes or the presence of volcanoes.

In this project, I tried to combine my passion for science, the desire to take advantage of new technologies to learn with my passion as a coder.
üåã It is also meant to be a stimulus to be more aware of the place we live on and a stimulus to a more innovative and technological way of learning science subjects.


In this project I used all native apple features and technologies.
I used Mapkit for the main feature of the app, thanks to the latest updates that the kit received during the last WWDC it was clear and beautiful to use.
In particular I used a 3d globe and used the Annotation functionality to develop my idea.
I used classes and a published variable in order to share my datas to more views and in order to keep clean and clear my code.
I made an onboarding in order to give a little brief about the arguments and the app.
Then I used SwiftUI, thanks to its simplicity, for all the major features and for the frontend of the app.
